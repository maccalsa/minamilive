# ðŸ“– **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Minimal Real-Time Toolkit** â€” a streamlined, secure, and highly performant framework designed specifically for building real-time web applications without frontend fatigue.

## ðŸš© **Why This Toolkit?**

Modern web apps have become bloated with complex JavaScript frameworks, extensive build tools, and unnecessary abstractions. Developers spend more time battling their tools than delivering value.

**This toolkit fixes that**. It provides:

* **Real-time capabilities** out of the box (WebSockets via HTMX).
* **Secure authentication** (JWT sessions and secure cookies).
* **Efficient client-side state persistence** (IndexedDB via Dexie.js).
* **Minimalistic frontend reactivity** (Alpine.js).
* **Automatic HTTPS/WSS handling** (Caddy).

## ðŸŽ¯ **Who Is This For?**

* Developers frustrated by heavyweight frameworks.
* Small-to-medium web apps needing real-time updates.
* Applications requiring secure and efficient state handling.
